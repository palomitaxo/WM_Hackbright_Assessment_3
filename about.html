		<h1>About</h1>

		<p>
		At 25 years old, I am a Tacoma, Washington native who recently made the vibrant city of San Antonio my home. With a background in Software Engineering, I am passionate about continuous learning and skill development to excel in my professional journey. With 14 months of intensive cybersecurity bootcamp training, 4 years of undergraduate schooling focused in Computer Science, awhile balancing full time work and personal life. Outside of work, my interests include staying active and exploring technology trends. I am excited about the prospect of bringing my skills and enthusiasm to contribute to the cybersecurity space.
